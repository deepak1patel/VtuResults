web scarping using selenium and bs4 on python I made this program to calculate sgpa and percentage of student. 

I use mac with pyhon 3.5.6 and safari web browser is used in this program 
you can check for one student also and for series of students by chaning some little changes into the program.
first you have enter usn of student and then since this time there is captcha so you have look at that enter that too which
gives sgpa and percenatge.

when [0-9][0-9][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9] then cridit is 2
